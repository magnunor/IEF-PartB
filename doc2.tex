\section{CV of the Experienced Researcher}
\label{sec:cv}

The CV is intrinsic to the evaluation of the whole proposal and is assessed throughout the 3 evaluation criteria by the expert evaluators. Please make sure that the information between part A and B is fully consistent.

Applicants without a doctorate should clearly justify any period of Full-Time Equivalent Research Experience in the CV part B (section 4). It is essential that the CV clearly explains how the Research Experience is calculated, following this template.

\medskip\noindent
This section should be limited to maximum 5 pages and should include \textbf{the standard academic and research record}. 
Any research career gaps and/or unconventional paths should be clearly explained so that this can be fairly assessed by the independent evaluators.

\medskip\noindent
The {\em experienced researchers} must provide a list of achievements reflecting their track record, if applicable:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Publications} in peer-reviewed scientific journals, peer-reviewed conference proceedings and/or monographs of their respective research fields, indicating also the number of citations (excluding self-citations) they have attracted.
	\item Granted \textbf{patent(s)}.
	\item \textbf{Research monographs, chapters} in collective volumes and any translations thereof.
	\item \textbf{Invited presentations} to peer-reviewed, internationally established conferences and/or international advanced schools.
	\item \textbf{Research expeditions} that the {\em experienced researcher} has led. 
	\item \textbf{Organisation of International conferences} in the field of the researcher (membership in the steering and/or programme committee).
	\item Examples of \textbf{participation in industrial innovation}.
	\item \textbf{Prizes and Awards}.
	\item Funding received so far
	\item \textbf{Supervising} and \textbf{mentoring} activities.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ethical Issues}
\label{sec:ethics}

Compliance with the relevant ethics provisions is essential from the beginning to the end of the action and is an integral part of research funded by the European Union within Horizon 2020.

\medskip\noindent
Applicants submitting research proposals for funding within Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in Horizon 2020 should demonstrate proactively that they are aware of and will comply with European and national legislation and fundamental ethical principles, including those reflected in the \href{http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf}{Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union} and the \href{http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf}{European Convention on Human Rights and its Supplementary Protocols}. 

Please be aware that it is the applicants' responsibility to identify any potential ethical issue, to handle the ethical aspects of the proposal and to detail how these aspects will be addressed.

\bigskip\noindent
{\large {\bf \ul{The Ethics Review Procedure in Horizon 2020}}}

\medskip\noindent
All proposals above threshold and considered for funding will be subject to an Ethics Review carried out by independent ethics experts. When submitting a proposal to Horizon 2020, all applicants are required to complete an ``{\bf Ethics Issues Table (EIT)}'' in the Part A of the proposal. 
in the Part A of the proposal. Applicants who flag ethical issues in the EIT have to complete also a more in depth {\bf Ethics Self-Assessment in Part B.}

\medskip\noindent
The ethics self-assessment will become part of the Grant Agreement and may thus lead to binding obligations that may later on be checked during ethics checks, reviews and audits.

\medskip\noindent
For more details, please refer to the H2020 \href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/ethics/h2020_hi_ethics-self-assess_en.pdf}{“How to complete your Ethics Self-Assessment”} guide


\bigskip\noindent
{\large {\bf \ul{Ethics Self-Assessment (Part B)}}}

\medskip\noindent
The Ethics Self-Assessment must:

{\bf
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Describe how the proposal meets the EU and national legal and ethics requirements of the country/countries where the task raising ethical issues is to be carried out. 
	\end{enumerate}
}

\medskip\noindent
For more information on how to deal with Third Countries (in the context of ethics appraisal, Third Country refers to non-EU country; Associated Countries are "ethics" TC) please see Article 34 of the \href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/amga/h2020-amga_en.pdf}{Annotated Model Grant Agreement}, as well as the following \href{http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm}{link}. Please ensure and confirm that the research performed outside the EU is compatible with the Union, National and International legislation and could have been legally conducted in one of the EU Member States.

\medskip\noindent
Please list the documents provided with their expiry date.

\medskip\noindent
Ensure early compliance of the proposed research with EU and national legislation on ethics in research. Should your proposal be selected for funding, you will be required to confirm that you have obtained the following documents (if applicable):

\begin{itemize}
	\item any ethics committee opinion required under national law and 
	\item any notification or authorisation for activities raising ethical issues required under national and/or European law 
\end{itemize}

\medskip\noindent
needed for implementing the action tasks in question.

\medskip\noindent
If you have not already applied for/received the ethics approval/required ethics documents when submitting the proposal, please indicate in this section the approximate date when you will obtain the missing approval/any other ethics documents. Please state explicitly that you will not proceed with any research with ethical implications before obtaining the necessary authorizations/ opinions.

\medskip\noindent
\fcolorbox{black}{gray!50}{\parbox{.95\textwidth}{
		{\em The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the beneficiary to the Agency (see Article 52). If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows that the action tasks in question are covered and includes the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned (if available). }
		
		\medskip\noindent
		{\em If you plan to request these ethics documents specifically for your proposed action, your request must contain an explicit reference to the} action'\em{s title.}
}}

\bigskip
{\bf 
	\begin{enumerate}[resume, start=2]
		\item \textbf{Explain in detail how you intend to address the ethical issues flagged, in particular with regard to:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the research \textbf{objectives} (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, cooperation with a Third Country, etc.)
			\item the research \textbf{methodology} (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related information and consent/assent procedures, data protection and privacy issues related to data collected, etc.)
			\item the potential \textbf{impact} of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage, malevolent use, etc.).
			\item appropriate health and safety procedures - conforming to relevant local/national guidelines/legislation - for the staff involved
			\item possible harm to the environment the research might cause, (as an example:  environmental risks of nanomaterials), and measures that will be taken to mitigate the risks.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
}

\section{Letters of Commitment (GF only)}
\label{sec:letters}

For the Global Fellowship proposals, a letter of Commitment\textbf{ of the partner organisations} (hosting the outgoing phase in a third country) must be included in part B-2 to ensure their real and active participation. these should not be attached as a separate PDF file or as an embedded file since this makes them invisible.

GF Proposals which fail to include a letter of commitment of the partner organisation will be declared \textbf{inadmissible}.

Minimum requirements for the letter of commitment: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{heading} or \textbf{stamp} from the institution; 
	\item up-to-date (may not be dated prior to the call publication);
	\item the text must demonstrate the will to actively participate in the (identified) proposed action and the precise role.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\noindent
Please note that no template for these letters is provided, only general rules.
