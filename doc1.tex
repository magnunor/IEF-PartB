\section{Excellence}
\label{sec:excellence}
~\footnote{Literature should be listed in footnotes, font size 8 or 9. All literature references \ul{will count} towards the page limit.}

\subsection{Quality and credibility of the research/innovation action (level of novelty, appropriate consideration of inter/multidisciplinary and gender aspects)}
\label{sec:excellence_quality}

You should develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction, state-of-the-art, specific objectives and overview of the action.
	\item Research methodology and approach: highlight the type of research / innovation activities proposed.
	\item Originality and innovative aspects of the research programme: explain the contribution that the action is expected to make to advancements within the action field. Describe any novel concepts, approaches or methods that will be implemented.
	\item The gender dimension in the research content (if relevant).
	
	\fbox{\parbox{.9\textwidth}{
			In research activities where human beings are involved as subjects or end-users, gender differences may exist. In these cases the gender dimension in the research content has to be addressed as an integral part of the proposal to ensure the highest level of scientific quality.
	}}
	\item The interdisciplinary aspects of the action (if relevant).
	\item Explain how the high-quality, novel research is the most likely to open up the best career possibilities for the \textit{experienced researcher} and new collaboration opportunities for the host organisation(s). 
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Quality and appropriateness of the training and of the two way transfer of knowledge between the researcher and the host}
\label{sec:excellence_transfer}

Describe the training that will be offered. 

Outline how a two way transfer of knowledge will occur between the researcher and the host institution(s):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain how the \emph{experienced researcher} will gain new knowledge during the fellowship at the hosting organisation(s).
	\item Outline the previously acquired knowledge and skills that the researcher will transfer to the host organisation(s).
\end{itemize}

For Global Fellowships explain how the newly acquired skills and knowledge in the Third Country will be transferred back to the host institution in Europe (the beneficiary) during the incoming phase.

Typical \textbf{training activities} in Individual Fellowships may include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Primarily, \textit{training-through-research} by the means of an \ul{individual personalised project}, under the guidance of the supervisor and other members of the research staff of the host organisation(s)
	\item Hands-on training activities for developing scientific skills (new techniques, instruments, research integrity, 'big data'/'open science') and transferrable skills (entrepreneurship, proposal preparation to request funding, patent applications, management of IPR, project management, task coordination, supervising and monitoring, take up and exploitation of research results).
	\item Inter-sectoral or interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge (e.g. through secondments)
	\item Taking part in the research and financial management of the action
	\item Organisation of scientific/training/dissemination events
	\item Communication, outreach activities and horizontal skills
	\item Training dedicated to gender issues
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Quality of the supervision and of the integration in the team/institution}
\label{sec:excellence_supervision}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Qualifications and experience of the supervisor(s)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Provide information regarding the supervisor(s): the level of experience on the research topic proposed and their track record of work, including main international collaborations, as well as the level of experience in supervising/training especially at advanced level (PhD, postdoctoral) researchers. Information provided should include participation in projects, publications, patents and any other relevant results.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hosting arrangements%
	\footnote{The hosting arrangements refer to the integration of the researcher to his new environment in the premises of the host. It does not refer to the infrastructure of the host as described in the Quality and efficiency of the implementation criterion.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The application must show that the experienced researcher will be well integrated within the team/institution in order that all parties gain maximal knowledge and skills from the fellowship. The nature and the quality of the research group/environment as a whole should be outlined, together with the measures taken to integrate the researcher in the different areas of expertise, disciplines, and international networking opportunities that the host could offer. 

\noindent
For GF both phases should be described - for the outgoing phase, specify the practical arrangements in place to host a researcher coming from another country, and for the incoming phase specify the measures planned for the successful (re)integration of the researcher. 




\subsection{Capacity of the researcher to reach or re-enforce a position of professional ma\-tu\-ri\-ty/\-in\-de\-pen\-den\-ce}
\label{sec:excellence_maturity}

Applicants should \textbf{demonstrate} how their professional experience and the proposed research will contribute to their development as independent/mature researchers, \textbf{during} the fellowship.

\medskip\noindent
Please keep in mind that the fellowships will be awarded to the most talented researchers as shown by the proposed research and their track record (Curriculum Vitae, section 4), in relation to their level of experience.

\medskip\noindent
A complete \textbf{Career Development Plan should not be included in the proposal}, but it is part of implementing the action in line with the European Charter for Researchers. It should aim at reaching a realistic and well-defined objective in terms of career advancement (by attaining a leading independent position for example) or resuming a research career after a break. The plan should be devised with the final outcome to develop and significantly widen the competences of the experienced researcher, particularly in terms of multi/interdisciplinary expertise, inter-sectoral experience and transferable skills.





\newpage
\section{Impact}
\label{sec:impact}

\subsection{Enhancing the potential and future career prospects of the researcher }
\label{sec:impact_researcher}
\medskip\noindent
Explain the expected impact of the planned research and training on the future career prospects of the experienced researcher \textbf{after} the fellowship.

\medskip\noindent
Describe the added value of the fellowship on the future career opportunities of the researcher. 

\medskip\noindent
Which new competences and skills will be acquired? How should these make the researcher more successful? 



\subsection{Quality of the proposed measures to exploit and disseminate the action results }
\label{sec:impact_dissemination}

\noindent
\setlength{\fboxsep}{3mm}
\fbox{\parbox{.95\textwidth}{
		{\large {\bf Dissemination, exploitation of results}}
		
		\medskip\noindent
		Dissemination and Exploitation strategy is about the results of the action and it is targeted at peers (scientific or the action's own community, industry and other commercial actors, professional organisations, policymakers) and to the wider research and innovation community - to achieve and expand the potential impact of the action. The proposal should describe the foreseen dissemination and exploitation activities and their expected impact.
		
		\medskip\noindent
		All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are expected to take a lead in ensuring that research is fruitful and that results are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or both) whenever the opportunity arises. 
		
		\medskip\noindent
		Please refer also to the \href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/grant-management/dissemination-of-results_en.htm}{"Dissemination \& exploitation" section of the H2020 Online Manual}. 
}}

\medskip\noindent
Describe how the new knowledge generated by the action will be disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Describe, when relevant, how intellectual property rights will be dealt with.

\medskip\noindent
A concrete planning for section~\ref{sec:impact_dissemination} must be included in the Gantt Chart (see point~\ref{sec:implementation_work_plan}).


\subsection{Quality of the proposed measures to communicate the action activities to different target audiences}
\label{sec:impact_communication}


\noindent
\setlength{\fboxsep}{3mm}
\fbox{\parbox{.95\textwidth}{
		{\large {\bf Background - Communication}}
		
		\medskip\noindent
		Communication of the action aims to demonstrate the ways in which the research, training and mobility contribute to a European "Innovation Union" and account for public spending. It should provide tangible proof that the funded action adds value by:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item showing how European and international collaboration has achieved more than would have otherwise been possible, notably in achieving scientific excellence, contributing to competitiveness and, where relevant, solving societal challenges;
			\item showing how the outcomes are relevant to our everyday lives, by creating jobs, training skilled researchers, introducing novel technologies, bringing ideas from research to market or making our lives more comfortable in other ways;
			\item promoting results, which may possibly influence policy-making, and ensure follow-up by industry, civil society and by the scientific community. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		\medskip\noindent
		In the MSCA, public engagement is an important part of communication. The primary goal of public engagement activities is to create awareness among the general public of the research work performed under these projects and its implications for citizens and society. The type of outreach activities could range from press articles and participating in European Researchers' Night events to presenting science, research and innovation activities to students from primary and secondary schools or universities in order to develop their interest in research careers. 
		
		\medskip\noindent
		Researchers should ensure that their research activities – both the action and, when available, its results – are made known to society at large in such a way that they can be understood by non-specialists, thereby improving the public’s understanding of science. Direct engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand public interest in priorities for science and technology and also the public’s concerns.
		
		\medskip\noindent
		For more details, see the guide on \href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/gm/h2020-guide-comm_en.pdf}{Communicating EU research and innovation guidance for project participants} as well as the \href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/grant-management/communication_en.htm}{``communication'' section of the H2020 Online Manual}.
}}

\medskip\noindent
The frequency and nature of communication activities should be outlined in the proposal. Concrete plans for the above must be included as a deliverable.

\medskip\noindent
A concrete planning for section~\ref{sec:impact_communication} must be included in the Gantt Chart (see point~\ref{sec:implementation_work_plan}).


\newpage
\section{Quality and Efficiency of the Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Coherence and effectiveness of the work plan}
\label{sec:implementation_work_plan}

The proposal should be designed in such a way to achieve the desired impact. A Gantt Chart should be included in the text listing the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Work Packages titles (for EF there should be at least 1 WP); 
	\item List of major deliverables, if applicable\footnote{A deliverable is a distinct output of the action, meaningful in terms of the action’s overall objectives and may be a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software, etc. Should the applicants wish to participate in the pilot on Open Research Data, the Data Management Plan should be indicated here. 
		Deliverable numbers ordered according to delivery dates. Please use the numbering convention <WP number>.<number of deliverable within that WP>. For example, deliverable 4.2 would be the second deliverable from work package 4.};
	\item List of major milestones, if applicable;%
	\footnote{Milestones are control points in the action that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the action where, for example, the researcher must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.}
	\item Secondments, if applicable.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The schedule should be in terms of number of months elapsed from the start of the action.
